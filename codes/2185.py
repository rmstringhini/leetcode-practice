'''
You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.

Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
